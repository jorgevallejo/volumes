**Volumes** is just a very simple script that I wrote to practise basic Python, 
as well as to get used to code in mobile phone environment (I used QPhyton3).

The script calculates volumes of geometric figures.
It displays a text menu, asks you which volume do you want to calculate,
and asks about applicable data (length, radius,...).
